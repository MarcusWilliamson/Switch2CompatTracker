    <h1>Switch 2 Game Compatibility Tracker</h1>
    <p>This site tracks the compatibility of Switch 1 games with the Switch 2, using information on the Switch eshop. Meant to be
        an up-to-date version of the PDFs on this page: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/">
            https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games</a>. Unaffiliated with Nintendo.

        This webpage updates itself daily at 4am and 4pm UTC. And yes, I know it's ugly, I don't know CSS :'(
