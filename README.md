#Switch 2 Game Compatibility Tracker

Live page: [https://marcuswilliamson.github.io/Switch2CompatTracker/](https://marcuswilliamson.github.io/Switch2CompatTracker/)

This page scrapes the Nintendo eShop for compatibility information on games in the list here: [https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/](https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/)

Will soon update daily, currently I run the program manually. Written in Python, uses BeautifulSoup4 for web scraping and Jinja2 for writing to HTML.
