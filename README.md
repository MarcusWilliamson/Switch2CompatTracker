# Switch 2 Game Compatibility Tracker

Update: Nintendo has an official site for this now: https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/


Live page: [(click here!) https://marcuswilliamson.github.io/Switch2CompatTracker/](https://marcuswilliamson.github.io/Switch2CompatTracker/)

This page scrapes the Nintendo eShop for compatibility information on the games listed in the PDFs here: [https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/](https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/)

Updates twice daily using GitHub Actions. Written in Python, uses BeautifulSoup4 for web scraping and Jinja2 for writing to HTML.

Thanks to [joshcampbell191](https://github.com/joshcampbell191>joshcampbell191) for sprucing up the page with Bootstrap 5 and Datatables!
